Displays some information about the website you're on right now.
#!Response:
I made this website in ~10 hours using FastAPI (Python) and HTMX. The frontend is ~100 lines long, only 12 of which are javascript. The backend is similarly tiny at ~70 lines.
These commands are defined by .info files that I parse to generate the help dialogue and responses, otherwise there's really nothing special going on.
There aren't any fun things on it, and it's pretty boring, but it was a lot of fun to make. I'll probably come back another day and add in `cowsay | fortune` or something.
Anyways I guess I'm off to host this on my vps  and figure out dns somehow.
