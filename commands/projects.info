Rhodium Programming Language 💻 <a href="https://github.com/evansnavage/Rhodium">https://github.com/evansnavage/Rhodium</a>: A programming language, so far I've designed the syntax, written 4 versions of a lexer and chosen the best approach, written a grammar and laid the foundation for writing the parser.

Alchemy Alley ⚗️ [Class Project, Introduction to Software Engineering] <a href="https://github.com/evansnavage/Swen261-Project-Alchemy-Alley">https://github.com/evansnavage/Swen261-Project-Alchemy-Alley</a>: Website made with Angular 17 and Spring. It's a fun little gamified website, and I learned a lot working on it.

Hand Waving Robot 👋: I'm the projects head at the Society of Software Engineers at RIT and we wave at tours, it's part of the tour script to call us the "friendliest club on campus". For 13 years people have tried, and allegedly sometimes succeeded, but mostly failed at crafting a robot to wave at tours alongside us, but there is no evidence of any successes. We believe the project to be cursed, but I will complete this project, and that robot will wave at tours and visitors to ImagineRIT 2025. Will also keep track of how many people are in our mentoring lab.

Inventory Management System 🗃️ <a href="https://github.com/evansnavage/legendary-octo-invention">https://github.com/evansnavage/legendary-octo-invention</a>: A project I worked on with a couple of friends for Brickhack 11, we didn't end up demoing, as we didn't build a frontend, but this was a great way for me to learn MongoDB and brush up on using Flask.
