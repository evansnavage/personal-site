!Future:
- Autoscroll down (for authenticity) [thanks abby]
- Fix input box width, the > moves off line at non 16:9 ratio
- Fun stuff (My implementations of cowsay and fortune maybe? Hell nightmare)
- About tabs pop out to the side and it tiles?
- Syntax Highlighting (will inflict a curse against my family for generations)
